                <p class="paragraph">Australian poetry has a long and rich history dating back to the 19th century.
                    During this time, poets began to explore themes and subjects unique to the Australian landscape,
                    such as the ruggedness of the bush, the harshness of the outback, and the relationship between
                    people and the land.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">One of the most famous Australian poets of the 19th century was Banjo Patterson,
                    whose works such as The Man From Snowy River and Clancy of the Overflow have become iconic
                    representations of Australian culture and identity.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">In the 20th century, Australian poetry continued to evolve, with poets like
                    Dorothea MacKellar and Oodgeroo Noonuccal exploring issues related to national identity,
                    multiculturalism, and Indigenous rights. Today, Australian poetry is a vibrant and diverse art form
                    that continues to reflect the complexities and contradictions of the Australian experience.</p>

                <h2>The Man From Snowy River</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">The Man From Snowy River is a poem by Banjo Patterson, first published in The
                    Bulletin magazine in 1890. The poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture a valuable
                    colt that has escaped into the wilds of the Snowy Mountains. The poem is considered a quintessential
                    representation of the Australian bush and its people.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Banjo Patterson was born in 1864 and is considered one of Australia's most famous
                    poets. He wrote many other famous poems, including Waltzing Matilda and Clancy of the Overflow.</p>

                <h2>My Country</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">My Country is a poem by Dorothea MacKellar, first published in 1908. The poem
                    celebrates the beauty and diversity of the Australian landscape, and expresses the author's love for
                    her country. The poem is often quoted in nationalistic contexts and has become a symbol of
                    Australian identity.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Dorothea MacKellar was born in 1885 and grew up on a property near Gunnedah in New
                    South Wales. She wrote many other famous poems, including Core of My Heart, My Country and Colours
                    of the Light.</p>

                <h2>We Are Going</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We Are Going is a poem by Oodgeroo Noonuccal, first published in 1964. The poem explores the
                    displacement and marginalization of Indigenous Australians in the wake of European colonization. It
                    is considered one of the most important works of Indigenous Australian poetry and a powerful
                    statement of resistance and identity.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Oodgeroo Noonuccal, formerly known as Kath Walker, was born in 1920 on Stradbroke
                    Island in Queensland. She was a prominent activist for Indigenous rights and a prolific writer,
                    publishing many works of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction.</p>
