                <p class="paragraph">Australian poetry has a long and rich history dating back to the 19th century.
                    During this time, poets began to explore themes and subjects unique to the Australian landscape,
                    such as the ruggedness of the bush, the harshness of the outback, and the relationship between
                    people and the land.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">One of the most famous Australian poets of the 19th century was Banjo Patterson,
                    whose works such as The Man From Snowy River and Clancy of the Overflow have become iconic
                    representations of Australian culture and identity.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">In the 20th century, Australian poetry continued to evolve, with poets like
                    Dorothea MacKellar and Oodgeroo Noonuccal exploring issues related to national identity,
                    multiculturalism, and Indigenous rights. Today, Australian poetry is a vibrant and diverse art form
                    that continues to reflect the complexities and contradictions of the Australian experience.</p>

                    <h2>The Man From Snowy River</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">The Man From Snowy River is a poem by Banjo Patterson, first published in The
                        Bulletin magazine in 1890. The poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture a valuable
                        colt that has escaped into the wilds of the Snowy Mountains. The poem is considered a quintessential
                        representation of the Australian bush and its people.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Banjo Patterson was born in 1864 and is considered one of Australia's most famous
                        poets. He wrote many other famous poems, like Waltzing Matilda and Clancy of the Overflow.</p>

                            There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around <br> That the colt from Old Regret had got away, <br> And had joined the wild bush horses -  he was worth a thousand pound, <br> So all the cracks had gathered to the fray. <br> All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far <br> Had mustered at the homestead overnight, <br> For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are, <br> And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight. <br><br>

                            There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup, <br> The old man with his hair as white as snow; <br> But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up — <br> He would go wherever horse and man could go. <br> And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand, <br> No better horseman ever held the reins; <br> For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand, <br> He learnt to ride while droving on the plains. <br><br>

                            And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast; <br> He was something like a racehorse undersized, <br> With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least — <br> And such as are by mountain horsemen prized. <br> He was hard and tough and wiry — just the sort that won't say die — <br> There was courage in his quick impatient tread; <br> And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye, <br> And the proud and lofty carriage of his head. <br>

                    <h2>My Country</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">My Country is a poem by Dorothea MacKellar, first published in 1908. The poem
                        celebrates the beauty and diversity of the Australian landscape, and expresses the author's love for
                        her country. The poem is often quoted in nationalistic contexts and has become a symbol of
                        Australian identity.</p>
    
                    <p class="paragraph">Dorothea MacKellar was born in 1885 and grew up on a property near Gunnedah in New
                        South Wales. She wrote many other famous poems, including Core of My Heart, My Country and Colours
                        of the Light.</p>

                            The love of field and coppice, <br> Of green and shaded lanes. <br> Of ordered woods and gardens <br> Is running in your veins, <br> Strong love of grey-blue distance <br> Brown streams and soft dim skies <br> I know but cannot share it, <br> My love is otherwise.<br><br>
                            
                            I love a sunburnt country, <br> A land of sweeping plains, <br> Of ragged mountain ranges, <br> Of droughts and flooding rains. <br> I love her far horizons, <br> I love her jewel-sea, <br> Her beauty and her terror - <br> The wide brown land for me!<br><br>
                            
                            A stark white ring-barked forest <br> All tragic to the moon, <br> The sapphire-misted mountains, <br> The hot gold hush of noon. <br> Green tangle of the brushes, <br> Where lithe lianas coil, <br> And orchids deck the tree-tops <br> And ferns the warm dark soil.<br><br>
                            
                            Core of my heart, my country! <br> Her pitiless blue sky, <br> When sick at heart, around us, <br> We see the cattle die - <br> But then the grey clouds gather, <br> And we can bless again <br> The drumming of an army, <br> The steady, soaking rain.<br><br>
                            
                            Core of my heart, my country! <br> Land of the Rainbow Gold, <br> For flood and fire and famine, <br> She pays us back threefold - <br> Over the thirsty paddocks, <br> Watch, after many days, <br> The filmy veil of greenness <br> That thickens as we gaze.<br><br>
                            
                            An opal-hearted country, <br> A wilful, lavish land - <br> All you who have not loved her, <br> You will not understand - <br> Though earth holds many splendours, <br> Wherever I may die, <br> I know to what brown country <br> My homing thoughts will fly.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        We Are Going is a poem by Oodgeroo Noonuccal, first published in 1964. The poem explores the
                        displacement and marginalization of Indigenous Australians in the wake of European colonization. It
                        is considered one of the most important works of Indigenous Australian poetry and a powerful
                        statement of resistance and identity.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Oodgeroo Noonuccal, formerly known as Kath Walker, was born in 1920 on Stradbroke
                        Island in Queensland. She was a prominent activist for Indigenous rights and a prolific writer,
                        publishing many works of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction.</p>

                        They came in to the little town <br> A semi-naked band subdued and silent <br> All that remained of their tribe. <br> They came here to the place of their old bora ground <br> Where now the many white men hurry about like ants. <br> Notice of the estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be Tipped Here'. <br> Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring. <br> 'We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers. <br> We belong here, we are of the old ways. <br> We are the corroboree and the bora ground, <br> We are the old ceremonies, the laws of the elders. <br> We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told. <br> We are the past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires. <br><br>

                        We are the lightening bolt over Gaphembah Hill <br> Quick and terrible, <br> And the Thunderer after him, that loud fellow. <br> We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon. <br> We are the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low. We are nature and the past, all the old ways <br> Gone now and scattered. <br> The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter. <br> The eagle is gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place. The bora ring is gone. <br> The corroboree is gone. <br> And we are going.' <br><br>
