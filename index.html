                    Australian poetry has a long and rich history dating back to the 19th century.
                    During this time, poets began to explore themes and subjects unique to the Australian landscape,
                    such as the ruggedness of the bush, the harshness of the outback, and the relationship between
                    people and the land.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    One of the most famous Australian poets of the 19th century was Banjo Patterson,
                    whose works such as The Man From Snowy River and Clancy of the Overflow have become iconic
                    representations of Australian culture and identity.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In the 20th century, Australian poetry continued to evolve, with poets like
                    Dorothea MacKellar and Oodgeroo Noonuccal exploring issues related to national identity,
                    multiculturalism, and Indigenous rights. Today, Australian poetry is a vibrant and diverse art form
                    that continues to reflect the complexities and contradictions of the Australian experience.

                    There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around <br> That the colt from
                    Old Regret had got away, <br> And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand
                    pound, <br> So all the cracks had gathered to the fray. <br> All the tried and noted riders
                    from the stations near and far <br> Had mustered at the homestead overnight, <br> For the
                    bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are, <br> And the stock-horse snuffs the
                    battle with delight. <br><br>

                    There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup, <br> The old man with his
                    hair as white as snow; <br> But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up —
                    <br> He would go wherever horse and man could go. <br> And Clancy of the Overflow came down
                    to lend a hand, <br> No better horseman ever held the reins; <br> For never horse could
                    throw him while the saddle girths would stand, <br> He learnt to ride while droving on the
                    plains. <br><br>

                    And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast; <br> He was something like a
                    racehorse undersized, <br> With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least —
                    <br> And such as are by mountain horsemen prized. <br> He was hard and tough and wiry — just
                    the sort that won't say die — <br> There was courage in his quick impatient tread; <br> And
                    he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye, <br> And the proud and lofty
                    carriage of his head. <br><br>

                    The love of field and coppice, <br> Of green and shaded lanes. <br> Of ordered woods and
                    gardens <br> Is running in your veins, <br> Strong love of grey-blue distance <br> Brown
                    streams and soft dim skies <br> I know but cannot share it, <br> My love is
                    otherwise.<br><br>

                    I love a sunburnt country, <br> A land of sweeping plains, <br> Of ragged mountain ranges,
                    <br> Of droughts and flooding rains. <br> I love her far horizons, <br> I love her
                    jewel-sea, <br> Her beauty and her terror - <br> The wide brown land for me!<br><br>

                    A stark white ring-barked forest <br> All tragic to the moon, <br> The sapphire-misted
                    mountains, <br> The hot gold hush of noon. <br> Green tangle of the brushes, <br> Where
                    lithe lianas coil, <br> And orchids deck the tree-tops <br> And ferns the warm dark
                    soil.<br><br>

                    They came in to the little town <br> A semi-naked band subdued and silent <br> All that remained
                    of their tribe. <br> They came here to the place of their old bora ground <br> Where now the
                    many white men hurry about like ants. <br> Notice of the estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be
                    Tipped Here'. <br> Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring. <br> 'We are as strangers
                    here now, but the white tribe are the strangers. <br> We belong here, we are of the old ways.
                    <br> We are the corroboree and the bora ground, <br> We are the old ceremonies, the laws of the
                    elders. <br> We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told. <br> We are the
                    past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires. <br><br>

                    We are the lightening bolt over Gaphembah Hill <br> Quick and terrible, <br> And the Thunderer
                    after him, that loud fellow. <br> We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon. <br> We are
                    the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low. We are nature and the past, all the
                    old ways <br> Gone now and scattered. <br> The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter.
                    <br> The eagle is gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place. The bora ring is
                    gone. <br> The corroboree is gone. <br> And we are going.'
